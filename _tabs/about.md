## About Me

I work at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Security, and AI Systems, with a focus on building and studying robust, trustworthy AI in real-world settings.

## My Work
Currently, I work on agent-based LLM systems, including task orchestration, memory and context management, and validation pipelines. Through this work, I am particularly interested in how complex AI systems fail in practice, and how security, robustness, and evaluation should be addressed at the system level.

My broader research interests include adversarial machine learning, AI system reliability, cloud security, and applied cryptography.

This site is a space to share my projects, research notes, and ongoing thoughts.
